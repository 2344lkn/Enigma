## -=[Project Enigma]=-
### [E]ncrypted [N]euraL [I]ntelligence [G]enerated [M]achine [A]pplication

 * Artificial Intelligence & Cryptography Analysis and Algorithm Generation
 * when combining all of the above in a way that is difficult for us to
 * understand you get Project Enigma. So lets use bad programming practices
 * and do things outside of the box off the beaten path of the standards.
 * What will come of it? Will we learn anything? Will we invent something new?
 * Chances are very slim except we may learn something but you never know.
 
* [De] Version State and Progress will be defined by 'Def' a max of 775
* [ED] Milestones or breakthroughs will be defined by 'ED' a max of 15.
* [Du] Invention of new crypto & AI algorithms defined by 'Dura' a max of 15.
* [Te] Tele represents the main project itself which if true is +Tele

Planned Features and Updates:
  - [Updates]:
  - Port Scan (Set a range of ports to scan instead of one port #)
  - kTm Crypto Algo (Fix two modes that are currently not working)
  - Url Scanner (Add more paths to scan for)
  - Poly Crypto (Optimize and Refine code if possible)
  
  - [Features]:
  - Text (Password Bruter)
  - Crypto (Secure Crypto) Blending kTm and Poly together to form a secure cryptography.
  - Crypto (Encrypted Communication) Encrypt messages and voice easily on skype, teamspeak and other com apps.
  - AI - Need to start working on the Artificial Intelligence side
