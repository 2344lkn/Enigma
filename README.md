### [E]ncrypted [N]euraL [I]ntelligence [G]enerated [M]achine [A]pplication
#### Project Goals:
##### - Create a command console with a assortment of useful or nonuseful tools [Text Tools] [Net Tools] [Crypto Tools] [AI Tools]
##### - Create an artificial intelligence that can identify what encryption algoroithm is used on an encrypted file or encrypted string/message and maybe learn to decrypt them.
##### - Create an artificial intelligence that can generate its own encryption algorithms.
##### - Create an artificial intelligence that can defend against cyber attacks and viruses.

###### If anyone would like to add a tool or would like to do some optimization or even work on AI or Crypto please feel free to do so! This project might never reach completion but thats fine its here so I can learn and try different things and maybe some of you would like to join me in this journy.

 * Artificial Intelligence & Cryptography Analysis and Algorithm Generation
 * when combining all of the above in a way that is difficult for us to
 * understand you get Project Enigma. So lets use bad programming practices
 * and do things outside of the box off the beaten path of the standards.
 * What will come of it? Will we learn anything? Will we invent something new?
 * Chances are very slim except we may learn something but you never know.
 
* [De] Version State and Progress will be defined by 'Def' a max of 775
* [ED] Milestones or breakthroughs will be defined by 'ED' a max of 15.
* [Du] Invention of new crypto & AI algorithms defined by 'Dura' a max of 15.
* [Te] Tele represents the main project itself which if true is +Tele

Planned Features and Updates:
  - [Updates]:
  - Port Scan (Set a range of ports to scan instead of one port #)
  - kTm Crypto Algo (Fix two modes that are currently not working)
  - Url Scanner (Add more paths to scan for)
  - Poly Crypto (Optimize and Refine code if possible)
  
  - [Features]:
  - Text (Password Bruter)
  - Crypto (Secure Crypto) Blending kTm and Poly together to form a secure cryptography.
  - Crypto (Encrypted Communication) Encrypt messages and voice easily on skype, teamspeak and other com apps.
  - AI - Need to start working on the Artificial Intelligence side
